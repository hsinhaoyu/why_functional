[Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf) is a classic programing article by John Hughes in 1990.

The original code was written in high-level functional language [Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_(programming_language)). I decided to implement the examples in Python. 

The code is written using `org-babel`, a literate programming tool that is part of Emacs. To extract the Python source code from the `.org` files, run `M-x org-babel-tangle` in Emacs. Or, `make tangle`.
