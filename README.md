[Why Functional Programming Matters](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf) is a classic programing article by John Hughes in 1990.

The original code was written in the style of high-level functional language [Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_(programming_language)). I decided to implement the examples in Python. 

The code is written with org-babel, a literate programming tool that is part of Emacs. To extract the Python source code, run =M-x org-babel-tangle= in Emacs.
